# CRCpredict


Leveraging large-scale plasma proteomics (4,907 proteins) and single-cell transcriptomics (183 samples), we employed pQTL-based causal inference and dynamic monotonic trend analysis to pinpoint a six-protein signature (VEGFA, SERPINE1, SH3BGRL3, BOLA1, TIE1, and XXYLT1) that drives the UC-to-CRC transition. Mechanistically, acting in concert, these six proteins drive pathological angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and immunosuppression, thereby forming a self-reinforcing vicious cycle that underpins the transition from colitis to colorectal cancer. To explore the translational potential of these causal drivers, we constructed risk prediction models based on their gene expression profiles using multiple machine learning approaches. These models consistently demonstrated excellent performance in both internal cross-validation and external independent cohorts. The optimal classification model achieved an AUROC of 0.987, while the survival model attained a C-index of 0.93 (5-year prediction AUROC: 0.982).
